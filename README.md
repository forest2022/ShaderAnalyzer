<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- Graph creation -->
## Graph  
The sample graphs of disassembly shaders can be found in  [Link to the folder](sample_graph/)


<!-- Scripts Explanation -->
## Scripts Explanation

All the scripts are written in python 3.8. To run the script, please lunch a python tools like Anaconda or directly run "python xx.py" 

###  Graph Analysis 
[Link to the folder](Graph_Analysis/)

An example of tfidf vectorization computation for 2 consecutive frame 

[figure 1 tfidf-vectorization computation](Graph_Analysis/tfid_vector_2consecutiveFrame_FS.py)

An example of WL kernel computation for 2 consecutive frame 

[figure 1 WL kernel calculation](Graph_Analysis/WL_kernel_2consecutiveFrame_FS.py)

### Single Game Analysis
[Link to the folder](Single_Game/)

1. Evolution of Shader Code Graphs

   [Figue3a plot](Single_Game/figure3a_barplot_node_FS.py)
	
	An example to analyze plot figure 3a.
	

2. Sudden Change Detection in Frames

   [Figure 8 plot](Graph_Analysis/WL_kernel_2consecutiveFrame_FS.py)
   
   An example for figure 8
   
3. A Frame's Scene Prediction

   [Prepare dataset (Merge all graphs)](Single_Game/merge_allgraph_into1_perframe_GTA5_cs_hs_ls.py)

   An example to merge all graphs in the same frame as one disjoint graph. 
   
   [GCN with interpretability library](https://github.com/tsKenneth/interpretable-graph-classification)

   Make use of the existing libraries for GCN and the result explainability.
	
### Intergame Analysis
[Link to the folder](Inter_Game/)

1. Frequent subgraph result analysis 

    Frequent subgraph mining utilized the library of gSpan in the link listed in useful link. 

    An example to list the number of frequent subgraphs obtained and their average number of node and edge: 
    
    Scripts:[figure12 plot](Inter_Game/boxplot_node_intergame.py)

    An example to convert gSpan output text to edgelist and nodelist: 
    
    Scripts:[convert gSpan result to graph format](Inter_Game/convert_fsm_file_to_edgelist_hash.py)

    An example to select longest distinct subgraphs from gSpan result: 
    
    Scripts: [select longest patterns from gSpan result ](Inter_Game/select_distinct_subgraph_labelgame.py)

2. Game clustering 
	
    There are 2 steps in community detection

    Step1: Dataset preparation 
    
	[Find max similarity for each pair of games' fsm](Inter_Game/WL_kernel_inter_game_fsm.py)
   
  	[Prepare train dataset](Inter_Game/prepare_dataset_clustering.py)


    Step2:clustering with PCA feature reduction
    
	[Clutering](Inter_Game/3dplot_Kmeans.py)
	
	This script using Kmenas with PCA feature reduction. The clustering result will be plotted in 3d as table3 figure.  


3. shader efficiency prediction

    There are 2 steps in community detection

    Step1: Dataset preparation

	[Prepare train dataset](Inter_Game/prepare_dataset_predict_efficiency_select_distinct_hw_used_in_shader.py)
	
    Step2: Classification  
    
	[random_forest](Inter_Game/random_forest_crossValidation.py)
